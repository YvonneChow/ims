prototype for E360 application

IMS LifeLink Treatment DynamicsTM is a new, harmonized multi-national application suite based on any patient level data. It comprises different backend components allowing to produce various reports (called applications) like Source of Business (SoB), Brand Performance (BP) Patients on Drug (PoD), Persistence, Compliance, Co-Medication etc.

IMS LifeLink Treatment DynamicsTM applications offer non-technical users an easy and smart online access to patient metrics based KPIs through enhanced best practice reports, analytics and dashboards on national & sub-national level. Initially Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and France started the project with more countries to join. New target audiences here are enabled to “turn predictive patient insight into targeted marketing action”.
